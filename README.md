README FILE (GitHub and Herokou Deployment)

A webapp to explore and visualise the USA Gas Pipeline incident data. There are 3 versions of the jupyter notebook file which evolved from simpler techniques to using plotly. The webapp has been mostly copied from the _v3 jupyter notebook iteration.

The following packages are used in this project:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Streamlit
- Plotly
